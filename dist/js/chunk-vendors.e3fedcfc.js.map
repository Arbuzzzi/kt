Shared access is\r\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\r\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\r\n *\r\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\r\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\r\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\r\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\r\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\r\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\r\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\r\n * primary.\r\n *\r\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\r\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\r\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\r\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\r\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\r\n * persistence.\r\n *\r\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\r\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\r\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\r\n *\r\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\r\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\r\n * operations will automatically fail.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\r\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\r\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\r\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\r\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\r\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\r\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\r\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n *\r\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\r\n * longer optional.\r\n */\r\nvar IndexedDbPersistence = /** @class */ (function () {\r\n    function IndexedDbPersistence(allowTabSynchronization, persistenceKey, clientId, platform, lruParams, queue, serializer, sequenceNumberSyncer) {\r\n        this.allowTabSynchronization = allowTabSynchronization;\r\n        this.persistenceKey = persistenceKey;\r\n        this.clientId = clientId;\r\n        this.queue = queue;\r\n        this.sequenceNumberSyncer = sequenceNumberSyncer;\r\n        this._started = false;\r\n        this.isPrimary = false;\r\n        this.networkEnabled = true;\r\n        /** Our window.unload handler, if registered. */\r\n        this.windowUnloadHandler = null;\r\n        this.inForeground = false;\r\n        /** Our 'visibilitychange' listener if registered. */\r\n        this.documentVisibilityHandler = null;\r\n        /** The client metadata refresh task. */\r\n        this.clientMetadataRefresher = null;\r\n        /** The last time we garbage collected the client metadata object store. */\r\n        this.lastGarbageCollectionTime = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;\r\n        /** A listener to notify on primary state changes. */\r\n        this.primaryStateListener = function (_) { return Promise.resolve();
